- `styles.css`: Defines the styling for all sections, including responsiveness.

## Code Review and Maintenance Notes
### HTML
1. **Semantic Tags**: Ensure all sections use semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for better accessibility and SEO.
2. **Alt Attributes**: Add descriptive `alt` attributes to all images for accessibility.
3. **Meta Tags**: Include meta tags for keywords and descriptions to improve SEO.

### CSS
1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming conventions for classes and IDs.
2. **Unused Styles**: Remove commented-out or unused styles to keep the CSS clean.
3. **Variables**: Consider using CSS variables for colors and font sizes to simplify future updates.
4. **Media Queries**: Ensure all breakpoints are tested on various devices.

### Future Improvements
1. **Dark Mode**: Add a toggle for dark mode to enhance user experience.
2. **Animations**: Use CSS animations to add subtle animations to sections.
3. **Form Validation**: Implement client-side validation for any forms.
4. **Accessibility**: Conduct an accessibility audit to ensure the website meets WCAG standards.
5. **Performance**: Optimize images and use lazy loading to improve page load times.
